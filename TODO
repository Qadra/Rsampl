=== Integration with sampling algorithms ===

We need:
- Specialized allocation/free functions
- specialized methods for invoking errors
- Easy code sharing between main branch and this branch

- Add submodule which contains .so module
  - Problem: Cannot easily (without function pointers eg.) control how to
    allocate/deallocate memory.

- Add the code wholesale into Rsampl
  - Problem: The code is now detached from the main branch and updates must be
    manually transferred between the two.

- Copy the code from the main repo on every change
  - Can use defines to overrule allocation functions et al.
  - Problem: Requires some special tooling
    - Makefile to copy files into src/?
 
- Find a way to use a submodule and include only the {c,h} files we need.

=== General TODO ===

- Use R error function
- Create interface to allow sampling a matrix, where each row is chosen from
  the same distribution
- Check the code for portability issues
- Check for memory leaks ...
- Decide on level of input sanitation
- Add options:
  - Add flag to indicate that the data sums to 1 so we don't need to normalize
- How do we handle huge small buckets in the RSTree
- Update the subsetsampling code so we don't use subset_t
- Test if C++ can be faster than C
